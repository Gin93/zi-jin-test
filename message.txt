I never used Spark so question 2 is skipped. 
I also never used Jenkins, but I tried my best to learn to solve the test. I took a whole day to learn it from scratch, I've done some work in the Jenkins server locally, but for the static code, I think that simple Jenkinsfile is the only thing I can submit.

Please let me know if anything else is needed. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Kind regards,
Zi Jin
